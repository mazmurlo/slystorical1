 msb.9.t: "AST Political Power Picks"
 msb.9.d: "Order of PP picks: Silent Workhorse, Partial Mobilization, (Attache to Spain with CP and Relief of Command with Army XP), Free Trade, War Industrialist, Army Defense Expert. Click Improved Workers and propaganda whenever after. Save PP for High Command (400pp) and Total Mob/Women in the Workforce (250pp). "
 msb.9.a: "Okay"
 msb.10.t: "AST Construction/Production"
 msb.10.d: "Build civilian factories until mid-1937, then build only military factories. Build in New Zealand first, then other high infra states. For production, start with 1 on trains, 6-7 on support equipment, and 1 on trucks when you get it. Put a couple mils on AA, AT (probably more on this), Arty, etc, and the rest on guns. Switch your gun line when you have a new one, switching to owned gun when you have it. You will overflow on guns, and be generous sending to your allies who may need it."
 msb.10.a: "Okay"
 msb.11.t: "AST Research"
 msb.11.d: "CONSTANTLY RESEARCH GUNS, you are rushing guns for the allies. You should use the 2 100% infantry equipment bonuses you get on Improved Infantry Equipment 2 and Gun 3. Hold your research if need be. Otherwise get industry, radio, AT tech, passives, and support companies."
 msb.11.a: "Okay"
 msb.12.t: "AST Army"
 msb.12.d: "Go Mass Mobilization doctrine (the right path of the rightmost doctrine), finishing before war. Your template for Africa should be 13 Infantry battallions with Support Logistics, Engineering Company, AA, and AT. For DDay remove the Engineering Company, and for Asia swap the AT with Artillery. Pick the Infantry Genius, Artillery Expert, and Army Logistics as High Command. Put Blamey as your General, Morsehead as your Field Marshall, make sure you have Last Stand Generals (ask about if need be). Send 50 divisions to Egypt by war. Ask UK for convoys and allies for help on anything."
 msb.12.a: "Okay"
 msb.13.t: "Railroad"
 msb.13.d: "Your focus tree has been railroaded for one reason or another, you're new to the server, new to the country, whatever. Play well as is and you won't be railroaded next time.
